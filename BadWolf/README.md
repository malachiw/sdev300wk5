This is the Lab4 project.

I am to create my own web page that uses most of the functionality discussed in
this weeks lab. Using PHP and HTML create a web app as described.

The web page will
 1. The Login form should consist of fields for username, email address and 
	password. 
 2. After login, a welcom message should appear providing a simple order form
	with at least 10 products of your choice. Be sure to include an image
	of the product and price. 
 3. Users can shop your store for up to 30 minutes before the session will 
	expire. 
 4. Once all prodcuts are selected, the user should be able to checkout and pay
	 for their purchases. 
 5. The payment page should display the username, email address and the product
	and total price of purchases.   
 6. A "Purchase" button should be available to indicate the product was 
	purchased and should generate a "Thank you" message of your choice. 
 7. On the Thank you message page, an option for logging out and essentially
	unsetting the stored sessions variables should be available and 
	implemented.
 8. Note all pages should have a session timeout functionality. 
    
For deliverables, a zip file containing a word document with screenshots of the
application running successfully along with PHP web app file.
